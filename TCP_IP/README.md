# üí° **TCP/IP**
**TCP/IP**= is a set protocols designed to transmit data over computer networks, including the Internet


**TCP**= ensures(guaranteed) that data is delivered correctly


**IP**= indicates where to send them


**IP Address**= unique confidential number for device


<br> We have two types of **IP Addresses**: IPv4 have 4 blocks and IPv6 have 8 blocks

## üî• IPv4 : <br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Example: *192.168.100* .10  
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*Subnet ID:* 192.168.100 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Numbers between 0-255
          <br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Host ID: .10 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Numbers between 1-254
<br>
## üî• IPv6 : <br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Example: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *FE80:0000:0000:B9A2:9200:92CC:8C12:A634*  
 &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or the same version of this IP Address: &nbsp; &nbsp; *FE80::B9A2:9200:92CC:8C12:A634*
          <br>

<br>
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0    &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Numbers between: 0-255(0-254)
<br>
<br>

 **Subnet ID** is like a number or address that tells you where in the network a computer or device is located.
<br>

 **Subnet mask** is like a set of instructions that tells a computer how to divide an IP address into two parts: one part identifies the subnet and the other part identifies the specific device in that subnet.
<br>

 **Host ID** is like a number or address that tells you which specific device or computer within the subnet is using that IP address.
In Host ID numbers: 0 and 255 doesn't use (doesn't exist for user usage) because number 0 is the base IP of IP Address. 
<br> Number 255 is a broadcast ID  

<br>

* If you want to take a lot of devices in one network, you should have the same Subnet ID and Subnet Mask.

  Host ID will be different for every device
<br>

### üíª **Address of your computer** (local or localhost):    
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IPv4 = 127.0.0.1   <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IPv6 = ::1

It can also will show you if protocols TCP/IP work

### ‚òùüèª Commands to check **IP Addresses**:

Linux: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ifconfig
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ip addr
<br> Windows:  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ipconfig

### üóëÔ∏è IP Addresses not for the **Internet**:

* 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 = *Virtual box*

* 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 = *Testing like PC Address*

* 172.10.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 = *Used in companies*

* 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.255.255 = *Private IP Addresses*
