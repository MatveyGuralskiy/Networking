# 📧 DNS
DNS = Domain Name System
### 🛤️ DNS Main Road
When we enter the address of website, browser checks the cache, if you don't have any data about this site,

It send request to **Resolver** = Recognize DNS Server

The **Resolver** usually locate in our provider

If the **Resolver** doesn't find our request, we send request to **Root Server**

**Root Server** will told you which server/branch you have to search

### 🌍 TLD

After that we should request to **TLD** (Top Level Domain)

**TLD** it's some address goes after dot(.) for example (.com or .net and more)

**gTLD** it's Education = (.edu), Machine Learning(AI) = (.ai) and other organizations, doesn't apply to regions/country

**ccTLD** (Country Code TLD) like (.us), (.uk), (.il)

DNS resolves(change) to human-readeble domains from IP-Addresses
