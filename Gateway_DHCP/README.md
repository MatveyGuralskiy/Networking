## ‚ùó Explanation of Demonstraion

* Your **Router** connects to the Internet and he gets some IP Address (97.134.78.43), It called Public IP

* The **Router** had Internal (*Local*) IP Address (192.168.1.1) and the Router gives to all devices which are connect to the WI-FI/Ethernet Address of IP Internal (they unique IP Address)

* To do this function Router should use **DHCP** Protocol

* You can connect for example in one time to the Router 254 unique devices

* After some time if, PC (Some device) doesn't use Router, Router **will remove him** and give to someone else his IP Address
